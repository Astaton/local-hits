# Home Theatre App

    This is a project I made to familiarize myself with Electron. The goal of this app is to allow users to use some of the features of popular streaming services with content that is on their local hard drive. For example skip intro, auto play a series, and browser through folders that they have added to their library by genre, type, etc. This project is still a work in progress.

## To try out the current dev version of the App

- Clone this repo to your local drive
- cd into the directory where the repo is cloned
- Run npm install
- Once dependencies are installed, run the command: 'npm run quick start'
